## These functions create a new matrix object that
## stores a matrix and caches its inverse

## This function, called makeCacheMatrix, contains a 
## set of functions that get and set the value of the
## matrix and its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
